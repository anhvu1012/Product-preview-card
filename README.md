## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to work in a mobile-first workflow. It's so much easier to implement the mobile version first and then work on the desktop version later on because it won't cause any major problem when e.g. resizing etc.
